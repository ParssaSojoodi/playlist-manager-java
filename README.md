# 🎶 Playlist Manager (Data Structures Project)

Welcome to my **Playlist Manager** project — built entirely in Java from scratch as part of my Data Structures coursework at the University at Albany.

This application simulates a real-world music playlist system, including:
- Array and Linked List data structure implementations
- Manual queue for recently played songs
- CLI (Command-Line Interface) for user interaction
- Custom sorting and searching algorithms

---

## 💡 Features

- ✅ Add, insert, or remove songs
- ✅ View and play songs (updates play count)
- ✅ Manually shuffle the playlist
- ✅ Sort playlist by title, artist, duration, or play count
- ✅ Search by title, artist, or genre
- ✅ View recently played songs (queue capped at 10)
- ✅ Switch between Array-based and LinkedList-based playlists

## 📁 Project Structure

```
├── Song.java                  # Song data model
├── PlaylistArrayList.java    # Playlist using custom array
├── PlaylistLinkedList.java   # Playlist using custom linked list
├── RecentlyPlayedQueue.java  # Queue implementation for recent plays
├── PlaylistManager.java      # Main CLI application
```

## ▶️ How to Run

1. **Make sure you have Java installed**
2. Open your terminal / command prompt
3. Compile all files:
   ```bash
   javac *.java
   ```
4. Run the program:
   ```bash
   java PlaylistManager
   ```

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Implementing linked structures from scratch (Linked Lists, Queues)
- Handling dynamic arrays manually (without built-in ArrayList)
- Creating CLI-based applications with user input
- Sorting/searching using bubble sort and string comparisons
- Clean and readable code organization with modular classes
